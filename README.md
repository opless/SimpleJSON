SimpleJSON
==========

Updated fork of http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/SimpleJSON

Don't expect lots of update, or even a tutorial how to use it.

It's just a simple, naive way to access JSON data.

The original author's version can also be found here: https://github.com/Bunny83/SimpleJSON
I assumed the license to be public domain (as much on the wiki is assumed to be), but it seems that the original author is using MIT now.
